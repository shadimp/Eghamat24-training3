AGREEMENT TERMS

 

This Afterpay Installment Agreement “Agreement” includes the Final Payment Schedule that is sent after you complete your purchase with the merchant that will contain your actual down payment, payment amounts and due dates. The Final Payment Schedule will supersede and replace the Payment Schedule.



Use of the words “you” and “your” throughout this Agreement refer to the borrower listed, and the words “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to the Originator listed or its assignees. As a condition of the disbursement of proceeds hereunder you agree to make a down payment equal to a portion of the final purchase amount confirmed by the merchant identified which shall be due prior to disbursement of any proceeds described below.



PROMISE TO PAY: The Agreement governs your repayment to us in connection with funds we disbursed at your direction and on your behalf to an approved merchant to acquire certain merchandise or services that you have selected. You promise to pay the sum of your down payment and other payment amounts under this Agreement on the dates and according to the amounts displayed as “Down Payment” and “Remaining Payment Schedule” (together, your “Payment Schedule”) as it may be revised by the Final Payment Schedule (inclusive of all taxes and fees), plus all other charges accruing under this Agreement until paid in full. You understand that the actual amounts and due dates of your “Down Payment” and the payments in your “Remaining Payment Schedule” will be provided to you electronically as a supplement to this Agreement (the “Final Payment Schedule.”)



THERE ARE NO FINANCE CHARGES AND NO INTEREST PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS AGREEMENT. The issuer of your Payment Method (defined below) may charge interest or other charges in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement between you and your Payment Method issuer.



Please note that Section 10 of this Agreement includes provisions that govern how claims we may have against each other are resolved. These provisions limit our liability and may require arbitration for a dispute that you assert against us. The Agreement includes important terms regarding your rights related to fees, dispute resolution and governing law.



This Agreement incorporates by reference all terms and conditions of our U.S. Terms of Service (available at https://www.afterpay.com/terms-of-service) and U.S. Privacy Policy (available at: https://www.afterpay.com/privacy-policy) unless explicitly superseded by this Agreement. In the event of a conflict with the U.S. Terms of Service or U.S. Privacy Policy, this Agreement shall govern with respect to the subject matter of such conflicting terms.



1.Use of Proceeds and Disbursement Authorization



By electronically accepting this Agreement and completing a purchase, you agree to pay the down payment amount to us, and we agree to disburse the proceeds under this Agreement to the merchant listed. You promise to repay us the amounts disclosed in your Final Payment Schedule provided to you electronically as part of this Agreement that will include any amounts added by you in addition to the purchase of goods and/or services. You also agree to pay any applicable Late Fees (as defined below) you incur under this Agreement. Please be aware that by entering this Agreement you are incurring a personal obligation for goods and/or services for personal use.



If your purchase is in a foreign currency, we will convert the amount of your purchase in a foreign currency into U.S. dollars based on the conversion rate we received from a third party as of the end of the prior business day. This rate may differ from other exchange rates and may differ from the rates in effect in the wholesale markets on the date you made the purchase. If you return your purchase, we will process the return based on the currency conversion rate used to determine the purchase price.



2.Installment Payments



When you accept this Agreement and complete a purchase, you will identify your preferred method of payment, designating an eligible US-issued checking account, credit or debit card as your “Payment Method.” In addition to any required down payment, you must make either three (3) or four (4) payments to us (each, an “Installment Payment”) in the amounts shown under “Remaining Payment Schedule” in your Final Payment Schedule. You are responsible for ensuring that you have sufficient funds available to make Installment Payments on the dates specified in your Final Payment Schedule.



Goods or services you may purchase using Afterpay may include arrangements whereby you owe periodic payments to a merchant on an ongoing basis. This can include, for example, a periodic monthly membership or subscription fee, such as a monthly membership. Such payments may be described by a merchant or Afterpay as subscriptions, membership fees, billing agreements, or similar terms (collectively, a ‘Subscription Service’). You may use Afterpay with participating merchants to make each periodic payment owed (‘Subscription Payment’) under a Subscription Service through a single down payment, plus three or four Installment Payments.



Each Subscription Payment Afterpay makes on your behalf to the participating merchant for a Subscription Service is a separate obligation owed by you to Afterpay. Whenever a Subscription Payment is owed to the merchant and you have not cancelled your Subscription Payment by notifying us in accordance with these terms, you authorize and instruct Afterpay to pay the Merchant from your Payment Method through your Afterpay Account. We will provide you with a separate Final Payment Schedule for each billing period.



Cancelling a Subscription Service



If you wish to cancel any goods or services offered by a merchant that is structured as a Subscription Service, you will be responsible for contacting the merchant directly to cancel the service in accordance with the merchant’s policies. You agree that we may rely on information from the merchant regarding whether a Subscription Payment is due to the merchant. If Afterpay makes a Subscription Payment on your behalf before you cancel in accordance with the merchant’s policies, or before the merchant notifies Afterpay of your cancellation with enough time for us to reasonably act upon it, you agree you remain obligated to pay your down payment and each of your Installment Payments for that Subscription Payment made on your behalf.



Cancelling your Subscription Payments with Afterpay



You may cancel any scheduled Subscription Payment by notifying us within 4 days of the next scheduled payment by contacting our Customer Service center at https://help.afterpay.com. By contacting Afterpay to cancel any scheduled Subscription Payment, Afterpay will also cancel any future Subscription Payment you have for goods or services offered by that merchant to you for that Subscription Service. You are responsible for any outstanding amounts or obligations imposed by the merchant on you as a result of your cancellation of the Recurring Payment amounts.



Please note, cancelling your Recurring Payment with Afterpay will not cancel any goods or services obtained from the merchant. As above, it is your responsibility to cancel goods or services obtained from a merchant by contacting the merchant directly. 



If you make all Installment Payments in full on their due dates, your final payment will be made on the Maturity Date identified in the Final Payment Schedule. You may prepay all amounts due under this Agreement in whole or in part at any time without a penalty and may make any payment early, in whole or in part, without penalty or premium at any time.



If you would like to change your Payment Method or make alternate payment arrangements, you are able to do so online or by contacting us at the email provided below. If you are having difficulty with a specific Afterpay feature, or if you have further issues or questions, you may contact us at info@afterpay.com. The Payment Method you select and any necessary authorization will not affect your obligation to pay when due all amounts payable under this Agreement. The foregoing authorization is in addition to, and not in limitation of, any rights of setoff we may have under applicable law.
